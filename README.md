- 👋 Hi, I’m @mleite88
- 👀 I’m a paleontologist but I use github to share the fork of my work related to hydrology and hydrological databases. 
- 🌱 I’m currently working on developing standards for storage of stream gauging data, in particular depth profiles. Data of this sort are collected to calculate cross section areas and stream discharge. They are also useful for documenting how a stream's shape changes over time.
- 💞️ I’m interested in collaborating with hydrologists and fluvial geomorphologists who study stream parameters and their evolution. If you have experience with databases designed for datasets of this sort, you could probably teach me a lot.
